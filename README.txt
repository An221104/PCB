A few words about the application of this PCB.

I designed this PCB with 7 signal inputs and 5 signal output lines including: 3 signal lines to control 12v leds using transistors, 2 lines using relays. This project is to control corridor lights with input signals from sensors or control from smartphones. Besides, I have integrated 2 connection ports for brightness, temperature and humidity sensors for mobile applications. This board uses 12VDC power.

I have a note for you when using.
The resistor values used in this file maybe incorrect.
You should calculate all resistor values for your project to be highly efficient.

Thank you!!!
