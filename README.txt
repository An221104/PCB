This PCB is designed for corridor lighting control applications. It includes 7 input signal lines and 5 output channels, consisting of:
- 3 outputs for controlling 12V LEDs via transistors,
- 2 outputs using relays for higher load switching.

The board supports input from motion or light sensors and allows remote control via smartphone. Additionally, it provides two sensor ports for connecting brightness, temperature, or humidity sensors, making it suitable for mobile and smart home applications. Power is supplied via a 12VDC input.

Note: The resistor values in the schematic may be placeholders. Please calculate and adjust resistor values according to your specific application to ensure optimal performance.


Thank you!!!
